This subpackage contains adapted source code from the Time-NLP project.

Origin: (user-provided clone of Time-NLP-master)
Original authorship notices retained in each file header where present.

The included Java files (TimeNormalizer, TimeUnit, TimePoint, RangeTimeEnum, stringPreHandlingModule) and the model resource TimeExp.m are licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) as inferred from the upstream project's stated licensing (not bundled here). Their presence in this application means the combined distribution may be subject to GPL obligations. If you intend to distribute this application and require a different licensing arrangement, you must either:

1. Obtain explicit relicensing / permission from the original authors; OR
2. Remove this subpackage and rely on the fallback rule-based parser; OR
3. Replace with a clean-room reimplementation.

Adapter layer (Kotlin code) outside of /timenlp/internal is original to this project and may be licensed differently, but dynamic linking/combination with GPL code could still impose GPL terms on distribution.

If uncertain, consult legal counsel before distribution.
